## About The Project
ArtNet Director is a Client-Server based application, for the selective redirection of Art-Net packets.
Its main purpose is to facilitate switching between multiple users when restricted to a limited amount of Art-Net nodes.
It is operated using a web interface meaning it runs as a server on another computer, which can then be accessed by other computers in a local network using a web browser.

## Installation

You'll need [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) installed on your machine to run this application.

* Download the latest jar file from the releases
* Put the jar file in a new directory
* Run the jar file, e.g. by double clicking it or from your command line:
``` sh
java -jar ArtNetDirector.jar
```

In the console you'll find what to open in the web browser

### Building from Source
This project was built using the following things:
* [Java](https://java.com/en/download/)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)


First, clone the repository and move into it:
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/gelaechter/ArtNetDirector && cd ArtNetDirector
```

Then install all npm packages, this also installs Webpack and TypeScript:
```sh
npm install
```

Run Webpack to compile TypeScript files: (this starts a watcher, stop it with ctrl+c)
```sh
webpack
```

Create a uber jar using gradle:
```sh
./gradlew shadowJar
```

## Usage
1. You start the application on a computer.
2. You configure nodes, their IP addresses etc. on the web administration panel. (address is found in the applications console)
3. All users set their Art-Net output to the IP address of the host server.
4. The users can then toggle to which nodes they want to transmit their Art-Net packets in the web user panel. (address also found in the applications console)
